     <h2>Conclusion</h2>
     <p>
        IBM Rational DOORS is not just a requirement management program - it is a collaboration space for different actors at every phase of a project.
     </p>
     <p>
        DOORS defines each phase of a project as a set of modules with links connecting objects in each module.  Links among objects in each model quickly reveal over-defined or poorly defined requirements.  Design objects without a corresponding link to a requirement item, may "scratch an itch" for the developer, but is out of scope relative to the user specification.  Requirement objects without a corresponding link to a testing object will not be confirmed upon completion of the project.  This may reveal that the requirement is not testable ("interface will be easy to use") or that further effort in test definition is required.  Links also reveal how a change within one module will affect all linked modules.  Views reveal these discrepancies to different user groups quickly and easily - speeding development of the project in the right direction.
     </p>
     <p>
        IBM Rational DOORS is a business-level software package.  It may be cost-prohibitive for educational or startup development project.  Luckily, IBM offers a 90-day free trial of the software hosted from their cloud server.  This allows any level of user to test the functionality of the system prior to using it in a professional setting.
     </p>
     <p>
        Finally, DOORS offers plug-ins such that every tool in your business management ecosystem can talk.
     </p>
     <p>
        DOORS seems like an easy sell to your next software engineering manager.
